description: "2160p Balanced targets consistent & immutable 2160p **HDR WEB-DLs w/\
  \ Lossy Audio**. \n- Special considerations are given to **Balanced** groups who\
  \ prioritize **streaming optimisation** over quality, falling somewhere around a\
  \ tier 2 WEB-DL. This includes groups like **BHDStudio**, **HONE** and **hallowed**.\n\
  - If no 2160p WEB-DL can be found, the profile will fall back to the 1080p Quality\
  \ Profile.\n- Transparent 2160p Encodes (\xE0 la  2160p Quality) are not allowed\
  \ as fallback since they are comparatively much larger than 2160p WEB-DLs"
