name: 2160p Remux
description: "This profile prioritizes quality above all else. It will attempt to\
  \ grab 2160p Remuxes, which are direct copies of 4K Blu-rays. These files include\
  \ very high bitrate video, lossless, often spatial, audio as well as the various\
  \ HDR formats - HDR10(+) and Dolby Vision. Instead of relying on a release group\
  \ metric to find the best remuxes, it uses the various video + audio formats introduced\
  \ prior, to find the best release. For example, Dolby Vision is preferred over HDR10\
  \ & TrueHD + Atmos is preferred over DTS-HD MA. \n\nThis profile does not fit into\
  \ the typical \"Quality -> Balanced -> Efficient\" triarchy since it's lossless. "
