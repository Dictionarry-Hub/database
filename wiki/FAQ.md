| Why isn't the highest scored release being grabbed?                 | You may have prefer propers and repacks on. This option forces releases with a proper / repack flag to be grabbed, even if it's Custom Format score is not the highest. To turn it off, navigate to Settings > Media Management > File Management and set Prefer Propers / Repacks to Do Not Prefer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| What's the difference between h264, x264, AVC, h265, x265 and HEVC? | **H.264 (AVC)**: A video compression standard.<br>**x264**: An open source encoder that produces H.264 videos.<br>**H.265 (HEVC)**: A more advanced video compression standard than H.264, offering better compression and quality for 4K and higher resolutions.<br>**x265**: An open source encoder that produces H.265 videos.<br><br>**Key Points**:<br>- HEVC/AVC refers to the codec in general<br>- H.264/5 refers to a lossless rip (WEB-DL or remux)<br>- x264/5 refers to encoded content (WEBRip or Blu-ray encode)<br><br>_Note: Many HEVC files are mislabeled, making it challenging to distinguish between lossless and lossy releases based on release names alone._ |
| What quality settings should I use?                                 | It's suggested that you should set everything to min / max since Profilarr uses custom formats to do the major selections. However you might run into the occasional sample download if you use lots of usenet indexers. If you do find that these are being grabbed, then you can set the minimum to be 1-2gb per hour for whatever quality you need it in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
