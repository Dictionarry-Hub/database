name: Remux
pattern: \bremux\b
description: A remux is a digital video file that maintains the exact quality of the
  original source (like a Blu-ray or DVD) by copying the video and audio streams without
  re-encoding them, essentially creating a perfect 1:1 copy. Think of it like carefully
  transferring the contents of a Blu-ray disc into a more convenient container file
  format (typically MKV), similar to pouring fine wine from its bottle into a decanter
  without changing the wine itself.
