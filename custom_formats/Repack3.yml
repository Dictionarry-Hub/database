description: 'Release groups use specific terms to indicate when they''re fixing issues
  in releases:

  In Scene releases, groups can only occupy one release slot, which leads to two different
  terms:

  - PROPER is used when a different group fixes issues in another group''s release

  - REPACK is used when a group fixes issues in their own release


  P2P releases are simpler - REPACK is typically used whenever a group releases a
  fixed version.


  REAL / RERIP indicate similar things but their specific meaning / origin is unclear.


  This custom format will catch level 3 fixes'
