name: Blu-ray
description: 'Blu-ray is a digital optical disc format that succeeded DVD, offering
  significantly higher storage capacity and video quality. It gets its name from the
  blue-violet laser used to read the disc, which has a shorter wavelength than the
  red laser used in DVDs, allowing it to store more data in the same physical space.
  Standard Blu-rays (also known as BD-25 for single-layer and BD-50 for dual-layer)
  store 25GB or 50GB respectively, typically containing 1080p video encoded with H.264/AVC
  at bitrates up to 40Mbps, alongside high-quality audio formats like DTS-HD MA (up
  to 24.5Mbps) or Dolby TrueHD (up to 18Mbps). '
